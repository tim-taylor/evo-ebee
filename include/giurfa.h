// The following data is based upon the results shown in Fig 3 of Giurfa et al 1995 "Colour preferences
// of flower-naive honeybees". The data represents the normalised preferences for dominant wavelengths
// over the range 360-570nm in steps of 1nm. Each line is a triplet where the first item is the
// wavelength, the second is the normalised preference for that wavelength, and the third is the
// cumulative normalised preference of all wavelengths up to and including this one.
// The data was calculated in the Google spreadsheet
