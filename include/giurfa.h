// The following data is based upon the results shown in Fig 3 of Giurfa et al 1995 "Colour preferences
// of flower-naive honeybees". The data represents the normalised preferences for dominant wavelengths
// over the range 300-650nm in steps of 1nm. Each line is a triplet where the first item is the
// wavelength, the second is the normalised preference for that wavelength, and the third is the
// cumulative normalised preference of all wavelengths up to and including this one.
// The data was calculated in the Google spreadsheet
// https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ag2KZJXWme94-OCUq_0wfUpgLc0gx6QeXrfgxQnoL2g/edit#gid=0
// Data has been extrapolated from Giurfa's original data down to 300nm and up to 650nm by extending
// a horizontal line from his minimal and maximum points (366nm and 563nm) to the new limits.
